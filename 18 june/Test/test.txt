Took a lot of time deciding on the hotel and finally chose ITC Grand Chola, Chennai for my birthday dinner to spend with family. Excellent hotel, both in service and location. The ambience of the place is magnificent.
Coming to the food we were served with chicken soup and a whole lot of starters from chicken to fish to prawns....

Stayed here through May 30 -31st. Was struck by the sheer luxury in everything, right from the moment you are welcomed to even the smallest detail in the room. Would I recommend this to f & f? Yes defenitely.. Thanks for one of the best luxury stays I have had.




This hotel was excellent - the overall ambience was pleasing and the décor and design throughout was very nice. The staff were superb - very courteous and service oriented in every aspect of the hotel - a special mention goes to Christley at the Café Marcara whose customer service and general hospitality was second to none. my room was a...

Me and my wife went for a dinner at this hotel. The foods were awesome. The hotel guys are also very customer friendly. My foreign guests also liked the food and they said that Indian foods are delicious. Thanks to the hotel.




ITC has an enormous equity and when you are visiting an ITC property, your expectations are already heightened. Now it's ITC's turn to stand up to that expectation and visiting Grand Chola had been a very good experience at best, certainly not a grand one. Having two different places for check in is certainly not too convenient. The structure does...

Amazing structure, great marbles, nice spread for breakfast, innovation in restroom, all electrical connections controlled from ipad. Staff prompt and active. Escalator has card scan security. Door open from ipad still has to work. Corporate rates need to be more consistent, it should not change by hour. Peshawari food quality is great and rates are even greater. Area should be...

Fantastic hotel and overall experience; the staff are so friendly and hospitable - the word hotel barely does it justice. From Ottimo to Peshwari, the on site restaurants are nothing short of exceptional. A special shout out to Christley at The Cafe Marcara, whose service was particularly outstanding




I visited the hotel at one of the most busiest time of the year but still the service from the concierge till the housekeeping was unbeatable. The always smiling staff made sure that I am comfortable at all point of the stay. The rooms were incomparable with my favorite iPads to control and a camera at the door( SAFETY at...

The name is worth the experience. Its grandeur amazes you from the moment you enter the gates. The imposing structure and the spacious insides are, truly, a luxurious experience.. But, rooms' size may not live up to the name. I found the rooms just like any other good hotel (may be the exterior raises one's expectations). Food is marvellous -...

It started out as a pretty good hotel, given the other options in Chennai. However, hotels don't last longer than a few year before they start to deteriorate in Chennai and the ITC is no different. Lights randomly turning on in the night, iPad controls malfunctioning and a flooding shower. I'll probably move on the the Park Hyatt next trip...
